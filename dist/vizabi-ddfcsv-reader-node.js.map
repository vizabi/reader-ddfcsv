Methods that operate on and return arrays, collections,\n     * and functions can be chained together. Methods that retrieve a single value\n     * or may return a primitive value will automatically end the chain sequence\n     * and return the unwrapped value. Otherwise, the value must be unwrapped\n     * with `_#value`.\n     *\n     * Explicit chain sequences, which must be unwrapped with `_#value`, may be\n     * enabled using `_.chain`.\n     *\n     * The execution of chained methods is lazy, that is, it's deferred until\n     * `_#value` is implicitly or explicitly called.\n     *\n     * Lazy evaluation allows several methods to support shortcut fusion.\n     * Shortcut fusion is an optimization to merge iteratee calls; this avoids\n     * the creation of intermediate arrays and can greatly reduce the number of\n     * iteratee executions. Sections of a chain sequence qualify for shortcut\n     * fusion if the section is applied to an array of at least two hundred\n     * elements and any iteratees accept only one argument. The heuristic for\n     * whether a section qualifies for shortcut fusion is subject to change.\n     *\n     * Chaining is supported in custom builds as long as the `_#value` method is\n     * directly or indirectly included in the build.\n     *\n     * In addition to lodash methods, wrappers have `Array` and `String` methods.\n     *\n     * The wrapper `Array` methods are:\n     * `concat`, `join`, `pop`, `push`, `shift`, `sort`, `splice`, and `unshift`\n     *\n     * The wrapper `String` methods are:\n     * `replace` and `split`\n     *\n     * The wrapper methods that
